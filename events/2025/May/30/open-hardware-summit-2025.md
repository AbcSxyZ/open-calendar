Since 2010, the Open Source Hardware Association - https://www.oshwa.org/, a 501(c)(3) not for profit charity, has
hosted the Open Hardware Summit- a comprehensive conference for the open hardware community and the ever changing open
source hardware movement.

Speakers include world renowned leaders from industry, academia, the arts and maker community. Talks cover a wide range
of subjects from electronics, mechanics to related fields such as digital fabrication, creative tech, fashion
technology, self-quantification devices, and IP law. As a microcosm of the Open Source Hardware community, the Open
Hardware Summit provides an annual, friendly forum for the community.

The Open hardware Summit is a place for anyone who enjoys making and sharing physical things in any way, even if you
aren't open hardware certified. We're interested in expanding the community of like-minded people.
