Open Source Summit (formerly LinuxCon) is a name for a series of annual conventions organized each year since 2009 by
the Linux Foundation. The first LinuxCon took place in North America. Linux Foundation started organizing similar events
in Europe and Japan.

Apart from keynotes given by some high-profile Linux people (such as Linus Torvalds or Greg Kroah-Hartman in
2009), Open Source Summit is increasingly used as a platform for open source thought leaders, influencers, hiring
managers, professionals, and developers in Information technology to talk about their plans for the technological
landscape and announce major news.
