Open Education Week (OE Week) is an annual celebration and opportunity for those working in Open Education to actively
share their achievements and learn about what others are achieving worldwide.

Open Education Week was launched in 2012 by Open Education Global as a collaborative, community-built open forum. Every
year OE Week raises awareness and highlights innovative open education successes worldwide. OE Week provides
practitioners, educators, and students with an opportunity to build a greater understanding of open educational
practices and be inspired by the wonderful work being developed by the community around the world.

OE Week operates as a distributed event; organizers provide details of their in-person or online events that are
published here as a calendar with events displayed in your local date/time. It aims to make visible all of the activity
happening globally in support of Open Education. While OEWeek focuses on just the first week in March, the time frame is
not a requirement. We aim to list all activities happening from January to the end of March.
