Many countries have implemented open science policies and initiatives that support researcher collaboration, publishing
reform, and investment in open infrastructure to ensure everyone benefits from scientific knowledge. The UNESCO
Recommendation on Open Science, announcements at G20, and other initiatives at the national level around the world
demonstrate how open science has become a high-profile goal. Libraries are essential to providing the necessary
infrastructure and skills to make open science and open access a reality, and many libraries are involved in these
initiatives already. At the same time, many other countries are currently developing policies, providing opportunities
for libraries to get involved, and to learn from these experience.

During this webinar, initiatives from the Asia-Oceania region in China and Indonesia will be presented. These include
initiatives that promote international collaboration, research data sharing, and open access publishing.
