Event probably in German.

The event will highlight the synergies between Open Science and Citizen Science. To kick things off, Olivia Denk and
Tizian Zumthurm will present the UNESCO recommendation on Open Science. They define Open Science as the principles of
transparency, accessibility and traceability in science and explain how Citizen Science involves the public in
scientific projects.

Project staff from InfoFlora, Long Covid Switzerland and the Zurich Central Library will briefly present their Citizen
Science projects.

The subsequent panel discussion will address the following questions: How can citizen science projects benefit from open
science? What best practices are there for combining both approaches? Finally, the audience is invited to ask questions
and actively participate in the dialogue.
