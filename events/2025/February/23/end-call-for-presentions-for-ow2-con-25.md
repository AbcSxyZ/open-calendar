OW2con is the European open source conference organized by OW2. An international meeting of developpers, IT companies,
academics and non-profit organizations, OW2con brings together the entire open source community, during two days of
presentations ranging from tech topics to business and ethical issues of open source. It also offers a unique
opportunity to establish contact with peers through friendly networking sessions. OW2con is open to all, the event is
free and all sessions are held in English.

This year we are giving the highlight on the theme of open source and responsible AI. Our aim is to lift the hood and
look beyond the AI buzz: open source and commons, data, sovereignty, privacy, explainability, legal framework, technical
stack, funding and economy, sustainability, research and education, interaction with people, impact on work and society,
etc. How will open source contribute to this transformation?
