## The international Open Science Conference

The Open Science Conference is an annual international conference dedicated to the Open Science movement. It provides a
unique forum for researchers, data stewards, librarians, practitioners, infrastructure providers, policy makers, and
other important stakeholders to discuss the latest and future developments in Open Science. In 2025, the conference
returns to its roots and takes place as a face-to-face event in Hamburg again.

This yearâ€™s conference will have a special focus on the intersection between Open Science and AI. The rapid integration
of artificial intelligence and corresponding tools into scientific research poses both new challenges but also
opportunities for Open Science practices. This requires a reflection on how this can be aligned with transparency,
accessibility, reproducibility, and reusability as core principles of Open Science.
