Open Access Week is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential
benefits of Open Access, to share what they’ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in
helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research.

Open Access to information – the free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research, and the right to
use and re-use those results as you need – has the power to transform the way research and scientific inquiry are
conducted. It has direct and widespread implications for academia, medicine, science, industry, and for society as a
whole.

Open Access Week is an invaluable chance to connect the global momentum toward the open sharing of knowledge with the
advancement of policy changes and the importance of social issues affecting people around the world. The event is
celebrated by individuals, institutions and organizations around the world.
