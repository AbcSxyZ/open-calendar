The EU Open Source Policy Summit is an invite-only event, bringing together a mix of  policymakers, business leaders,
academics and community members, ensuring a fruitful exchange of views and a wide representation of stakeholders.

The Summit provides an informal setting for the audience to meet and learn from one another. We pride ourselves on
providing the best possible hallway-track, allowing guests to cherry-pick sessions after setting up meetings and making
new connections. 

The EU Open Source Policy Summit is Europeâ€™s premier event for high-level open source policy discussions. This Summit
provides a platform for the new EU administration to engage in meaningful dialogue with the European open source
community. As authorities on the innovation model powering the digital domain, our speakers will explore ways to harness
open source and global collaborative innovation to establish a competitive and sovereign digital environment. The event
will feature insights from leading policymakers, OSS business leaders, software stewards, advocates, and academics.
Together, they will share their perspectives and propose strategies for shaping the digital policy framework over the
next five years.
