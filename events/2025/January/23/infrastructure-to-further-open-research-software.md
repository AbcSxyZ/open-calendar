Over the past six months, IOI has been conducting a study to better understand the research software infrastructure
landscape. This study explored critical connections between infrastructure services, identified gaps and
vulnerabilities, and highlighted success factors for advancing sustainability and resilience in the ecosystem. Through a
combination of desk research, stakeholder interviews, and analysis, IOI has developed a robust understanding of what is
most needed to support and strengthen the research software ecosystem.
