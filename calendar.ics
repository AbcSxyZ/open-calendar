DESCRIPTION:Event Website: https://os.helmholtz.de/en/events/online-seminars/70th-online-seminar/\n\nIn his talk "Public Sector Open Source Program Offices - Archetypes for how to Grow (Common) Institutional Capabilities"\, Johan LinÃ¥ker will present a study\, commissioned by the European Commission\, which delves into the structural configurations and strategic utilisation of Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs) within the public sector domain\, with a specific focus on OSPOs within European Union (EU) member states\, Norway\, Liechtenstein\, and Iceland. The investigation is based on interviews conducted with 18 OSPO representatives across 16 cases. The study classifies OSPOs into six distinct archetypes\, providing insights into their organisational structures\, responsibilities\, and contributions to the adoption of Open Source Software (OSS). It also highlights the challenges encountered by OSPOs and provides recommendations for both policymakers and practitioners.

DESCRIPTION:Event website: https://www.open-science-conference.eu/\n\nThe Open Science Conference is an annual international conference dedicated to the Open Science movement. It provides a unique forum for researchers\, data stewards\, librarians\, practitioners\, infrastructure providers\, policy makers\, and other important stakeholders to discuss the latest and future developments in Open Science. In 2025\, the conference returns to its roots and takes place as a face-to-face event in Hamburg again.\n\nThis yearâ€™s conference will have a special focus on the intersection between Open Science and AI. The rapid integration of artificial intelligence and corresponding tools into scientific research poses both new challenges but also opportunities for Open Science practices. This requires a reflection on how this can be aligned with transparency\, accessibility\, reproducibility\, and reusability as core principles of Open Science.

DESCRIPTION:Open Access Week is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of Open Access\, to share what theyâ€™ve learned with colleagues\, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research.\n\nOpen Access to information â€“ the free\, immediate\, online access to the results of scholarly research\, and the right to use and re-use those results as you need â€“ has the power to transform the way research and scientific inquiry are conducted. It has direct and widespread implications for academia\, medicine\, science\, industry\, and for society as a whole.\n\nOpen Access Week is an invaluable chance to connect the global momentum toward the open sharing of knowledge with the advancement of policy changes and the importance of social issues affecting people around the world. The event is celebrated by individuals\, institutions and organizations around the world.
